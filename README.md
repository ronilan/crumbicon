# Crumbicon

Crumbicon is a mouse driven icon editor for your terminal. 

It creates, and then edits svg images that can be used as website favicons (i.e. the little icons that appear at the top tabs etc.). Icons can be 8 pixels by 8 pixels, or 16 pixels by 16 pixels, utilizing 256 colors. 

It's written in [Crumb](https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb).

### Locally

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone git@github.com:ronilan/crumbicon.git
```

CD into directory: 
```
cd crumbicon
```

Build Crumb Interpreter and Loaf Bundler: 
```
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

Run (using interpreter):
```
./crumb crumbicon.crumb
```

Build:
```
./loaf crumbicon.crumb crumbicon
```

Run (as stand alone executable):
```
./crumbicon
```

### With Docker:

Build: 
```
docker build -t crumbicon git@github.com:ronilan/crumbicon.git#main
```
Run: 
```
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/crumbicon/icons crumbicon
```

Or "all in one": 
```
docker run --rm -it -v ${PWD}:/crumbicon/icons $(docker build -q git@github.com:ronilan/crumbicon.git#main)
```

Then in the shell:
